class GenerateScraperNode(BaseNode):
    """
    A node that generates an answer using a language model (LLM) based on the user's input
    and the content extracted from a webpage. It constructs a prompt from the user's input
    and the scraped content, feeds it to the LLM, and parses the LLM's response to produce
    an answer.

    Attributes:
        llm: An instance of a language model client, configured for generating answers.
        node_name (str): The unique identifier name for the node, defaulting 
        to "GenerateScraperNode".
        node_type (str): The type of the node, set to "node" indicating a 
        standard operational node.

    Args:
        llm: An instance of the language model client (e.g., ChatOpenAI) used 
        for generating answers.
        node_name (str, optional): The unique identifier name for the node. 
        Defaults to "GenerateScraperNode".

    Methods:
        execute(state): Processes the input and document from the state to generate an answer,
                        updating the state with the generated answer under the 'answer' key.

        The method updates the state with the generated answer under the 'answer' key.

        Args:
